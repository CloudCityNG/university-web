Ruby Mendicant University is a free online training program aimed at helping intermediate Ruby developers improve their software development skills.  We aim to create a welcoming environment for passionate students to learn, grow, and share in.  Our courses are designed from the ground up to support these goals, and small class sizes combined with active personalized guidance from our instructors make for a unique experience not usually found in online training programs.

### Core Skills Course

At the heart of RMU is the core skills course, an intense three week program that is designed to help students hone their craft through active practice in several important topic areas.  Each session features an exercise on each of the following topics:

  * Modeling complex business logic
  * Integration with third party software libraries and/or web services
  * Practical application of high-level software design principles
  * Contributing to community projects

While some of the above topics may seem dry, we attack them in a lighthearted way, typically through building games, chat/email/twitter bots, and other useful tools that are fun to work on.  This helps students stay engaged and learn the concepts within a relevant context rather than simply gaining an intellectual understanding of the problem.  To encourage this even more, we require each student to propose and then develop an individual project during the three week session as well. 

Throughout the course, the instructor as well as some student mentors are highly available for feedback and one on one mentoring.  We use the exercises to give everyone a common set of goals for the course, but use our conversations with students to address their individual concerns and problem areas.

### Other Courses

Students who successfully complete the core skills course become part of the RMU Alumni network.  Starting in 2011, the RMU Alumni will have a number of courses to choose from to help them continue to improve their skills.  Once we've had a chance to test-drive some of our new course ideas, we'll be sure to update this page with some more details on our alumni course offerings.

### Our Staff

Ruby Mendicant University was founded by Gregory Brown ([@seacreature](http://twitter.com/seacreature)), author of the book [Ruby Best Practices](http://rubybestpractices.com) and original author of the popular PDF generation library [Prawn](http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com).  Gregory hopes that RMU will serve as a good example of what can happen when the ideas behind the Free Software Movement are applied to education.

Jordan Byron ([@Jordan_Byron](http://twitter.com/jordan_byron)) serves as RMU's technical coordinator, and is the maintainer of our classroom administration software, [university-web](https://github.com/rmu/university-web).  In addition to working alongside Gregory doing consulting work through [Madriska](http://madriska.com), Jordan volunteers his time working on CT Mission of Mercy's [clinic management system](https://github.com/jordanbyron/mission_of_mercy).

Jia Wu is RMU's administrative coordinator, and assists with various miscellaneous tasks that would otherwise be neglected by Jordan and Gregory.  Jia is a post-doctoral psychology researcher at the Yale Child Study Center, where she works on developing software for experiments as well as statistical programming for brain wave analysis.  Jia is also Gregory's wife, and is responsible for tearing him away from the computer every once in a while.

### Getting Involved With RMU

We are not currently accepting new students, but stay tuned for announcements of new entrance exams and other public events on the [RMU Public mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-mendicant-university----public).  We also have the #rmu-public channel on irc.freenode.net where you 
can meet with RMU participants and discuss the program with them.

We are also in need of financial support, seeing as RMU is a non-commercial project that is ultimately an unpaid full time job for Gregory and a major commitment for Jordan as well.  We are in the process of getting a non-profit set up, but for now, you can help support us by subscribing to Gregory's [Practicing Ruby](http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/gregory/028-practicing-ruby.html) newsletter.  For $5 a month you can get some insights into the kinds of things we're learning at RMU while still contributing to a good cause.

Finally, you can keep track of what people are saying about Ruby Mendicant University by watching the #RbMU hash tag on twitter.  As we're often too busy working on building RMU itself to do active public relations, this might be a good way to keep an eye on our activity from the sidelines.
