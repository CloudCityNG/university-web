### Getting Involved With RMU

We are not currently accepting new students, but stay tuned for announcements of new entrance exams and other public events on the [RMU mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/rmu-talk).  We also have the #rmu channel on irc.freenode.net where you 
can meet with RMU participants and discuss the program with them.

We are also in need of financial support, seeing as RMU is a non-commercial project that is ultimately an unpaid full time job for Gregory and a major commitment for Jordan as well.  We are in the process of getting a non-profit set up, but for now, you can help support us by subscribing to Gregory's [Practicing Ruby](http://blog.rubybestpractices.com/posts/gregory/028-practicing-ruby.html) newsletter.  For $8 a month you can get some insights into the kinds of things we're learning at RMU while still contributing to a good cause.

Finally, you can keep track of what people are saying about Ruby Mendicant University by watching the #RbMU hash tag on twitter.  As we're often too busy working on building RMU itself to do active public relations, this might be a good way to keep an eye on our activity from the sidelines.
