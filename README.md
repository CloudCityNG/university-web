# The sun is setting on University Web

After several years of dedicated service, we've decided to put University Web
out to pasture. Starting March 2012 we will no longer be accepting patches or
maintaining University Web. We have instead decided to focus our efforts a
replacement system called
[Liskvov](https://github.com/mendicant-university/liskov).

Lastly, we'd like to give a big thanks to all the wonderful people who have
contributed to University Web over the years. Your efforts made the work we do
at Mendicant University possible. Thank you <3
