It is important to keep in mind that RMU is unlike any other internet based training course out there.  Since most of the teaching is personalized to meet your particular needs, if you go more than a couple days without interacting with Gregory as well as several of your fellow students, you're doing it wrong!  Make good use of the session mailing list and IRC channel from day one, and you'll end up getting the most out of the course.

You can find the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/rmu-session-3
) on google groups, be sure to monitor it for announcements.

Students from previous sessions have written up a [FAQ](http://github.com/rmu/wiki/wiki/RMU-FAQ) as well as a guide as to [how to make the most of your session](http://github.com/rmu/wiki/wiki/Making-The-Most-of-Your-RMU-Session).  It's a good idea to read their advice since they've already been down this path before.  

### Important Milestones

*Checkpoint 1 (2010.11.10)*

At least one assignment must be accepted by this time, and there must be at least one useful feature implemented in the individual project.

At this point, review groups will be formed and each group will be assigned an alumni mentor.

*Checkpoint 2 (2011.11.17)*

At least two assignments must be accepted by this time, and significant further progress must be made on the individual project, based on discussions from Checkpoint 1.

At this point, a plan for final deliverable features on the individual project will be made.

*Checkpoint 3 (2011.11.22)*

Three of the four assignments must be accepted by this time.  The final evaluation of the individual project will be made based on earlier conversations.

At this point, alumni status will be awarded to those who qualify.  Those who have not met requirements will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
